                    I studied programming both at university and on my own, and I'm currently working as a full-stack
                    software engineer at a large international company. My go-to tools are React (and React-based

                <p>Over the years, I've worked on several passion projects and contributed to open-source game mod
                    development. </p>

                    <h2>Mindset</h2>
                    <p>Do you know those people who always complain how bad everything is,
                        while they do nothing to move forward? You know, like the ones who still watch reality shows.
                        Or the ones fighting in the comment sections.
                    </p>
                    <p>Well, I am not like them and of course those guys will never be so cool to have a website, so you
                        might already suspect you are in a good place! :D
                    </p>
                    <p>I prefer moving forward and keep things simple instead of always creating fake drama for myself.
                        I never give up, I keep my head down and work humbly until I reached my current goals.
                        I assume being mentaly and also phisically balanced and healthy is a key to success.

                    <h2>Why programming?</h2>
                    <p>My passion for coding came when I was 14.
                        I had to decide what I wanted to do with my life, in order to be able to choose the most
                        suitable
                        secondary school.
                        Honestly I just googled "best jobs" and then I saw a lot of IT related things on the list.
                        I really liked playing games on the computer so I was like: "Oh, so if I choose something
                        like
                        this,
                        it is gonna be a great excuse to sit even more in front of screens."
                    </p>
                    <p>So that's the big story!
                        Jokes aside, it wasn't such an irresponsible decision of course, and I am still satisfied with
                        my choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>It turned out to be a great decision after all.</p>
