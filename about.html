                    I am studying programming both in school and by myself. Currently my main areas are backend and
                    fronted web application development and I also have experience with desktop apps.
                </p>
                <p>I am trying to improve myself in every possible way and learn something new when I just have the
                    possibility to do so. I am an open person and I like to get to know new people and discover new
                    things.</p>

                    <p>Do you know those people who always complain how bad everything is,
                        while they do nothing to move forward? You know, like the ones who still wathc reality shows.
                        Or the ones fighting in the comment sections.

                    <p>Well, I am not like them and of course those guys will never be so cool to have a website, so you
                        might already suspect you are in a good place!
                    </p>
                    <p>I prefer moving forward and keep things simple instead of always creating fake drama for myself.
                        I assume being mentaly and also phisically balanced and healthy is a key to success.

                    <h2>Why programming?</h2>
                    <p>My passion for coding came when I was 14.
                        I had to decide what I wanted to do with my life, in order to be able to choose the most
                        suitable
                        secondary school.
                        Honestly I just googled "best jobs" and then I saw a lot of IT related things on the list.
                        I really liked playing stupid games on the computer so I was like: "Oh so if I choose somthing
                        like
                        this,
                        it is gonna be a great excuse to sit even more in front of screens."
                    </p>
                    <p>Yeah so that's the big story.
                        Jokes aside I am a completely different person now, and I like doing this.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was a surprisingly good decision after all.</p>
